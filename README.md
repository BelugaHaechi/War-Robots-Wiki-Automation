# War-Robots-Wiki-Automation
Automation project for datatables on warrobots.fandom.com. Integrates excel data into parseable wikitext and HTML. 

Mainly uses excel read&write package `openpyxl`, and the handy built-in `math` package. The weapons simulator includes complex logic calculations, beware :)

__NOTE:__ The excel datasheet provided is for display purposes only. Do not distribute, since some data and features are experimental and incomplete.
