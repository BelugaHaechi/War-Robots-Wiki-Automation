# War-Robots-Wiki-Automation

__UPDATE: This project has been transferred to VBA code within the Excel datasheet. This repository remains for legacy reasons and will not be further updated, but the project will continue! Thank you for your interest.__

Automation project for datatables on warrobots.fandom.com. Integrates Excel data into parseable wikitext and HTML. 

Mainly uses excel read&write package `openpyxl`, and the handy built-in `math` package. The weapons simulator includes complex logic calculations, beware :)

__NOTE:__ The excel datasheet provided is for display purposes only. Do not distribute, since some data and features are experimental and incomplete.
